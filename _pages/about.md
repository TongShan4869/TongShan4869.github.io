> Science is art.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in biomedical engineering at the University of Rochester, where I conduct research on the neural mechanisms of auditory processing, perception and cognition, using techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and computational modeling with qualitative and quantitative methods. I specifically interested in auditory encoding of natural sounds, such as speech and music.

In addition, I have various experience related to digital signal processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning.
I am passionate about applying my expertise in audio, hearing science and data analysis to improve the quality of life and well-being of people.

I am also a music producer focused on composing, game music and sound design, as well as music-visual art, where I explore the creative and expressive potential of sound and technology. I am always eager to learn new skills, challenge myself, and contribute to the advancement of science and technology.
You can find my music projects in my personal portfolio website [Cu | 无水醋酸铜](https://teenagingcu.com/) .
